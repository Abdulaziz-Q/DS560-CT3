Critical Thinking Assignment 3 is part of DS560 (Advanced Data Mining) course

### CT3: Data Classification

We were asked to perform the following tasks:

**Task 1:** An explanation about different classes that already exist in the dataset.

**Task 2:** Python code that builds different data classifiers (at least two) using the different classification algorithms, trains those classifiers using the training data, and displays their accuracy results.

**Task 3:** Python code to run those classifiers on the test data and compare their results and accuracy. Discuss the reasons for different accuracies.

**Task 4:** A summary of the results and findings.
